        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! my name is Aron Limos. Im currently 19 and turning 20 this summer. I love sports such as volleyball
            and basketball. I perfer to play basketball over volleyball because all my friends always plays basketball.
            My favorite colour is blue and my favorite food to snack on is anything with nutella or chocolate.

        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I am new to coding, my only experience was Scracth Cat where I made a mini game where a ball bounces of a
            moving platform to break a wall. That is all I made and I am a complete noob to the rest. I do hope to learn
            as much
            as I can during this school period and will do my best to learn everything. Otherwise, Nice to meet ya!
